## Goal(s) of the demo:

* To work with the `substring()` method from the String class.

  * The method is overloaded, `substring(int a)` will create a substring until the end of the string.

  * `substring(int a, int b)` will create a substring from index a (inclusive) to index b (exclusive).

* `indexOf(String ch)` is a method from the string class that reports the index that reports the first occurrence of string ch.

  * **If the substring does not exist then method will report the value -1.**

* `lastIndexOf` may be useful, but wasn't need here.

* do `+=` when adding a character to a string.
